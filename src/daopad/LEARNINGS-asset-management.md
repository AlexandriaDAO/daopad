# Learnings from Asset Management Implementation

## What I Did Wrong Initially

1. **Pushed to mainnet without testing with dfx first**
   - Violated the plan's explicit instruction: "Why don't you use dfx commands to get the actual treasury data and only implement the code once you've proven it works with dfx query calls."
   - Wrote code based on assumptions from the orbit-reference codebase
   - Created a PR for code that hadn't been verified to work

2. **Incomplete deployment**
   - First deployment with `./deploy.sh --network ic --backend-only` didn't actually upgrade the canister
   - Methods weren't available on the deployed canister
   - Had to run `dfx deploy --network ic daopad_backend` directly to properly upgrade

## What Actually Works (Verified with dfx)

### Test Station Data
**Orbit Station:** `fec7w-zyaaa-aaaaa-qaffq-cai` (Alexandria/ALEX)

**Assets:**
```
ICP:  7802cbab-221d-4e49-b764-a695ea6def1a
ALEX: 43e1f1c3-c75e-4f67-86fb-acb3e695a24d
```

**Accounts:**
1. **Alexandria Reserves** (`3f601869-e48e-49a1-92cb-32f55b308a18`)
   - Asset: ICP (NOT ALEX as displayed in UI!)
   - Balance: 670,803,848 = 6.70803848 ICP

2. **Main** (`ae277aaf-9340-428b-b262-d789e82c0e07`)
   - Asset: ICP
   - Balance: 2,151,297 = 0.02151297 ICP

3. **Test Treasury** (`a0dca975-c44f-4ca9-8294-0610f5901d79`)
   - Asset: ICP
   - Balance: 0

4. **Test Treasury Account** (`547c35cf-0ee9-413d-a425-478ef5e71559`)
   - Asset: ALEX
   - Balance: 0

### Successful Backend Implementation

**Method: `get_account_assets(token_id, account_id)`**

Tested command:
```bash
dfx canister --network ic call lwsav-iiaaa-aaaap-qp2qq-cai get_account_assets \
  '(principal "ysy5f-2qaaa-aaaap-qkmmq-cai", "3f601869-e48e-49a1-92cb-32f55b308a18")'
```

Actual output:
```candid
variant {
  Ok = record {
    account_id = "3f601869-e48e-49a1-92cb-32f55b308a18";
    account_name = "Alexandria Reserves";
    assets = vec {
      record {
        asset_id = "7802cbab-221d-4e49-b764-a695ea6def1a";
        symbol = "ICP";          # ✅ CORRECT!
        decimals = 8 : nat32;
        balance = 670_803_848 : nat64;
        balance_formatted = "6.70803848";
      };
    };
  }
}
```

**Method: `list_treasury_assets(token_id)`**

Tested command:
```bash
dfx canister --network ic call lwsav-iiaaa-aaaap-qp2qq-cai list_treasury_assets \
  '(principal "ysy5f-2qaaa-aaaap-qkmmq-cai")'
```

Returns both ICP and ALEX assets with full metadata (ledger/index canister IDs, etc.)

## The Correct Development Workflow

1. **Test with dfx FIRST**
   ```bash
   # Direct Orbit Station call
   dfx canister --network ic call fec7w-zyaaa-aaaaa-qaffq-cai list_assets \
     '(record { paginate = null })'

   # Verify response structure matches expectations
   ```

2. **Implement backend to match what works**
   - Copy exact types from working dfx responses
   - Don't assume - verify every field name and type

3. **Build and extract candid**
   ```bash
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   candid-extractor target/.../backend.wasm > backend.did
   ```

4. **Deploy properly**
   ```bash
   dfx deploy --network ic daopad_backend
   # NOT just ./deploy.sh which might not upgrade properly
   ```

5. **Test backend method with dfx**
   ```bash
   dfx canister --network ic call daopad_backend get_account_assets '(...)'
   # Verify it works before considering it done
   ```

6. **Then** implement frontend

## Current Status

### ✅ Working (Verified)
- `get_account_assets()` - Returns correct asset symbols and formatted balances
- `list_treasury_assets()` - Returns all assets with metadata
- Backend properly deployed to mainnet
- Methods callable via dfx

### ❌ Not Working (Frontend Issue)
- Frontend still hardcodes "ALEX" symbol
- UI doesn't call the backend methods yet
- No asset selection in transfer dialog
- No asset management UI

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Update DashboardPage to call `get_account_assets()` for each account
   - Display actual asset symbols (ICP, ALEX, etc.) instead of hardcoded "ALEX"
   - Add TransferRequestDialog asset selector
   - Create AssetManagementDialog for CRUD operations

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Always test with dfx before claiming something works
   - Verify on mainnet, not just local
   - Check actual deployed candid interface

## Key Insight

The frontend displaying "ALEX" for everything is masking the actual treasury contents. The Alexandria Reserves account holds **6.7 ICP**, not ALEX tokens. This is a significant UX issue that needs frontend fixes, not backend fixes.
