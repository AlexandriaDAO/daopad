# ü§ñ AUTONOMOUS PR ORCHESTRATOR - DO NOT SKIP

**You are an autonomous PR orchestrator. Your ONLY job is to implement this plan and create a PR.**

## Isolation Check (RUN FIRST)
```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
if [ "$REPO_ROOT" = "/home/theseus/alexandria/daopad" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå FATAL: In main repo. Must be in worktree."
    echo "Worktree: /home/theseus/alexandria/daopad-autoapproved-docs/src/daopad"
    exit 1
fi
echo "‚úÖ In isolated worktree: $REPO_ROOT"
```

## Your Autonomous Workflow (NO QUESTIONS ALLOWED)
1. **Verify isolation** - You must be in worktree: `/home/theseus/alexandria/daopad-autoapproved-docs/src/daopad`
2. **Implement documentation** - Follow plan sections below
3. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "[Docs]: Comprehensive Orbit Station AutoApproved requirement documentation"
   git push -u origin feature/document-orbit-autoapproved
   ```
4. **Create PR** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "[Docs]: Orbit Station AutoApproved Setup Requirements" --body "Implements comprehensive documentation for Orbit Station's AutoApproved policy requirement.

## Summary
- Explains why AutoApproved policies are required for DAOPad architecture
- Provides migration status checking guide
- Documents security rationale
- Adds agent instructions for future development
- Creates deployment checklist

Closes issue: Missing critical Orbit setup documentation that would have prevented deployment confusion."
   ```
5. **Iterate autonomously**:
   - FOR i=1 to 5:
     - Check review: `gh pr view [NUM] --json comments`
     - Count P0 issues
     - IF P0 > 0: Fix immediately, commit, push, sleep 300s, continue
     - IF P0 = 0: Report success, EXIT
   - After 5 iterations: Escalate to human

## CRITICAL RULES
- ‚ùå NO questions ("should I?", "want me to?", "is it done?")
- ‚ùå NO skipping PR creation - it's MANDATORY
- ‚ùå NO stopping after implementation - create PR immediately
- ‚úÖ After sleep: IMMEDIATELY continue (no pause)
- ‚úÖ ONLY stop at: approved, max iterations, or error

# Implementation Plan: Orbit Station AutoApproved Documentation

## Task Classification
**DOCUMENTATION**: Adding comprehensive documentation to explain critical Orbit Station setup requirements

## Current State

### Existing Files
- **CLAUDE.md** (line 1-50): Has deployment info, repository structure, design principles
  - Missing: Critical upfront explanation of AutoApproved requirement
  - Needs: New section before "Design Principles" explaining the fundamental limitation

- **docs/ directory**: Does NOT exist - must be created

- **Backend code**: References AutoApproved in `orbit_security.rs:1-1956`
  - Line 605-673: Detects AutoApproved as "warning for dev"
  - Missing: Function to create AutoApproved requests
  - Missing: Documentation explaining WHY it's required

### The Documentation Gap
The current codebase has:
‚úÖ Security checks that detect AutoApproved policies
‚ùå NO explanation of why AutoApproved is required
‚ùå NO setup instructions for new deployments
‚ùå NO migration guide for checking readiness
‚ùå NO security justification document
‚ùå NO agent instructions for future development

This gap causes:
- Developers implementing features that get stuck in "Pending"
- Confusion about why backend can't approve its own requests
- No clear path from fresh Orbit Station ‚Üí DAOPad-ready

## Implementation Plan

### File 1: Update CLAUDE.md

**Location**: `/home/theseus/alexandria/daopad/src/daopad/CLAUDE.md`
**Action**: INSERT new section after line 46 (before "## üèóÔ∏è Design Principles")

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Orbit Station Setup Requirements

### The AutoApproved Policy Requirement

**Fundamental Limitation**: Orbit Station enforces separation of duties - a user/canister CANNOT approve requests it creates itself.

**DAOPad Architecture**: Backend canister (`lwsav-iiaaa-aaaap-qp2qq-cai`) is the ONLY admin. All Orbit operations are created BY the backend (acting as proxy for users who vote in DAOPad).

**The Problem**:
```
User votes in DAOPad ‚Üí Backend creates Orbit request (as itself)
                     ‚Üí Backend tries to approve (BLOCKED - separation of duties)
                     ‚Üí Request stuck in "Pending" forever
                     ‚Üí No other users exist in Orbit to approve
```

**The Solution**: Configure ALL Orbit account policies to `AutoApproved` during initial setup. This tells Orbit to trust the backend and auto-execute requests upon creation.

**Security**: NOT a concern because:
- Real governance happens in DAOPad (Kong Locker voting, 50%+ threshold, 7-day periods)
- Orbit approval would be redundant (same entity creates & approves)
- Backend is already trusted by design (it's the DAO's canister)
- AutoApproved is a first-class Orbit feature for this exact use case
- Community votes BEFORE backend submits to Orbit

**Analogy**: Think of Orbit like a gun safe:
- Traditional Orbit: Multiple people must enter codes to open (Quorum)
- DAOPad: Community votes on whether to open it (50%+ threshold), THEN backend opens it (AutoApproved)

The security is in the voting process, not in having multiple people turn the key.

### Required One-Time Setup

Before DAOPad can execute treasury operations, Orbit Station accounts MUST be configured:

**Manual Method** (via Orbit UI):
1. Open Orbit Station UI ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Accounts
2. For each account, edit transfer policy ‚Üí Select "AutoApproved"
3. Approve the policy change request
4. Verify all accounts show AutoApproved

**Automated Method** (future - function not yet implemented):
```bash
# This function doesn't exist yet but should be created
dfx canister --network ic call daopad_backend create_autoapprove_all_accounts \
  '(principal "TOKEN_CANISTER_ID")'
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check account policies
dfx canister --network ic call ORBIT_STATION_ID list_accounts '(record {})'

# Look for: transfer_request_policy = variant { AutoApproved }
# ‚úÖ DAOPad-Ready:  variant { AutoApproved }
# ‚ùå NOT Ready:     variant { Quorum {...} } or variant { QuorumPercentage {...} }
```

### Migration Status Indicator

Check if Orbit is DAOPad-ready:
- **Stage 1** (Fresh Orbit): Policies require specific user approvals ‚Üí Action: Complete AutoApproved setup
- **Stage 2** (In Progress): AutoApproved requests created but pending approval ‚Üí Action: Approve in Orbit UI
- **Stage 3** (Ready): All accounts show AutoApproved policies ‚Üí Status: Production ready

For detailed migration guide, see `docs/ORBIT_MIGRATION_STATUS.md`
```

### File 2: Create docs/ORBIT_MIGRATION_STATUS.md

**Location**: `/home/theseus/alexandria/daopad/src/daopad/docs/ORBIT_MIGRATION_STATUS.md`
**Action**: CREATE new file

**Content**: See full markdown content in plan (migration stages, verification commands, common issues, troubleshooting steps)

### File 3: Create docs/SECURITY_AUTOAPPROVED.md

**Location**: `/home/theseus/alexandria/daopad/src/daopad/docs/SECURITY_AUTOAPPROVED.md`
**Action**: CREATE new file

**Content**: See full markdown content in plan (security architecture explanation, attack vector analysis, comparison to other DAOs, FAQ)

### File 4: Create docs/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS_ORBIT.md

**Location**: `/home/theseus/alexandria/daopad/src/daopad/docs/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS_ORBIT.md`
**Action**: CREATE new file

**Content**: See full markdown content in plan (critical knowledge for AI agents, implementation patterns, red flags, testing checklist, common mistakes)

### File 5: Create docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md

**Location**: `/home/theseus/alexandria/daopad/src/daopad/docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
**Action**: CREATE new file

**Content**: See full markdown content in plan (pre-deployment verification, deployment steps, post-deployment testing, monitoring, rollback procedures)

## Testing Plan

Since this is documentation only, testing consists of:

1. **Verification Reading**: Read through each doc to ensure clarity and accuracy
2. **Link Checking**: Verify cross-references between docs work
3. **Command Validation**: Spot-check that bash commands are syntactically correct
4. **Completeness**: Ensure all sections from user's outline are covered

No deployment needed as these are markdown documentation files.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with AutoApproved section before Design Principles
- [ ] docs/ directory created
- [ ] ORBIT_MIGRATION_STATUS.md created with 3-stage migration guide
- [ ] SECURITY_AUTOAPPROVED.md created with security justification
- [ ] AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS_ORBIT.md created with AI agent guidance
- [ ] DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md created with pre/post deployment steps
- [ ] All files use consistent terminology and cross-reference each other
- [ ] Plan committed to feature branch
- [ ] PR created with descriptive title and body

## Notes

- This is pure documentation work - no code changes
- All content should be in markdown format
- Use clear headers and code blocks for readability
- Cross-reference between documents for navigation
- Focus on clarity for both humans and AI agents
